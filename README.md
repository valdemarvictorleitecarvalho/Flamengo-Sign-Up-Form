# Flamengo Sign-Up Form

Welcome to the **Flamengo Sign-Up Form** repository! This project is a modern, responsive form for user registration. The idea came about after the new president of the Flamengo football team promised that he would revolutionize the club's technological environment, so I made my fictitious registration form to access the team's virtual structure.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Build a **fully functional sign-up form** for user registration.
- Practice using **HTML5** form elements and form validation.
- Apply **CSS styling** to make the form visually appealing and responsive across devices.
- Learn how to integrate **user experience (UI/UX)** design principles for a smooth user interface.

## Technologies

This project uses the following core web development technologies:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the layout of the page and form elements.
- **CSS3**: For styling the form, input fields, buttons, and overall page design.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The form adapts to various screen sizes and looks great on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures the user fills in all the required fields and provides feedback if any information is missing or invalid.
- **Input Styling**: The form fields have custom styles, including focused field highlighting and hover effects on buttons.
- **Modern UI/UX**: The form design uses modern colors, fonts, and layout to ensure an intuitive user experience.
- **Submit Button**: The form includes a "Create Account" button that will submit the form (logic can be further developed to integrate with back-end services).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Flamengo-Sign-Up-Form.git
